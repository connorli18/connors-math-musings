\section{Brawl Stats}
\subsection{Background}
For the past couple of months, I have been using the Brawl Stars API to gather stats on some of my friends. Although this is actually stil in development, I have been collecting player information, brawler stats, as well as battle logs. My ultimate goal (along with my friend George) is to create some comparison tool between players to determine the ``truly best'' player among us. I want to be be able to compare things like:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Star Player Counts (with comparison between players and when friends play with each other)
    \item Brawler Stats (like win rates, average kills, etc.)
    \item Battle Preference Logs (to see how well we do in certain game modes)
    \item Trophy Progression Statistics
    \item And more! (hmu if you have any ideas)
\end{itemize}
I've been kinda lazy the past few weeks, so I haven't contributed much on this repository, but I will kick it back up again!
