<div class='section'>Brawl Stats</div><div class='subsection'>Background</div>For the past couple of months, I have been using the Brawl Stars API to gather stats on some of my friends. Although this is actually stil in development, I have been collecting player information, brawler stats, as well as battle logs. My ultimate goal (along with my friend George) is to create some comparison tool between players to determine the "truly best" player among us. I want to be be able to compare things like:<div class="itemize"><ul><li> Star Player Counts (with comparison between players and when friends play with each other)<li> Brawler Stats (like win rates, average kills, etc.)<li> Battle Preference Logs (to see how well we do in certain game modes)<li> Trophy Progression Statistics<li> And more! (hmu if you have any ideas)</ul></div>I've been kinda lazy the past few weeks, so I haven't contributed much on this repository, but I will kick it back up again!<div class='subsection'>Resources</div><div class="itemize"><ul><li> <b>GitHub Repo:</b> <a href="https://github.com/connorli18/brawl-stats" style="text-decoration: underline;">here</a></ul></div>
