<div class='section'>Columbia Sommelier</div><div class='subsection'>Background</div>The Columbia Sommelier is a project that I worked on, where I wanted to create a wine recommendation system for broke college students. The idea was to use a dataset of wines and their respective ratings to create a recommendation system that would suggest wines to users based on their preferences and allow students to interact on their favorite wines!
