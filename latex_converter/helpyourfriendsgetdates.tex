\section{Help Your Friends Get Dates}
\subsection{Introduction}
I love my friends, but they have literally no game whatsoever. So, I have created a website in hopes that they can use it to find more dates.
For more romantic advice, good luck - I am not your guy. But for a website (that has nothing to do with that), I maybe am your guy.
