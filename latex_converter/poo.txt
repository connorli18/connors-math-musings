<div class='section'>DFA Construction & Language Regularity</div><div class='subsection'>Problem Statement</div>Let $L$ be a language consisting of all strings $a$'s and $b$'s with an equal number of $ab$ and $ba$ as substrings. Is $L$ a regular language?<div class='subsection'>A Formal Proof</div>For the language described, to prove that it is regular, all we need to do is construct a valid DFA. For the language $L$, let's call its respective DFA $D$. To construct $D$, let's begin by defining the components of the DFA $D(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0,F)$.<ol class="enumerate"><li> $Q:$ We will use 5 states labeled $\{q_0,\;\dots\;,q_4\}$ detailed in the description below<li> $\Sigma:$ $\{a,b\}$ as defined by the problem<li> $\delta:$ transition function will be outlined in more detail in the diagram below<li> $q_0:$ the initial state<li> $F:$ set of $\{q_0,q_1,q_2\}$ outlined in the diagram below.</ol>The transition diagram is as follows:

<div class="itemize"><ul><li> State $q_0$ serves as an accept state to accept the empty string<li> State $q_1$ is the accept state for strings beginning with $a$, utilizing the state $q_4$ to cycle between equal and not equal substrings of $ab,ba$.<li> States $q_2,q_3$ are the mirror of the left side of the diagram except they consider strings that start with $b$ - bouncing between equal and not equal substrings of $ba,ab$</ul></div>Essentially, $q_0$ accepts the empty string in $L$. Next, if the string starts with $a$, the transition function takes you to the left part of the DFA, and if the string starts with $b$, the transition function takes you to the right part of the DFA. There, you bounce between the two states (either $q_1,q_4$ pr $q_2,q_3$) as the substring amounts of $ab,ba$ change. And since this a valid DFA for the language, we know that the language it represents is regular.
