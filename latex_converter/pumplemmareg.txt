<div class='section'>Pumping Lemma & Language Regularity</div><div class='subsection'>Problem Statement</div>Let $L$ be a language consisting of all strings $a$'s and $b$'s with an equal number of $aa$ and $bb$ as substrings. Is $L$ a regular language?<div class='subsection'>A Formal Proof</div>Let's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that the language $L$ is regular and has a pumping length $p$. One example of a family of strings in the language described would be the following string $w$ with $p-1$ substrings of $aa$ and $bb$:$$w = a^{p}b^{p} = \underbrace{aaa\dots aaa}_{p\;\text{times}}\overbrace{bbb\dots bbb}^{p\;\text{times}}$$In this case, we can only consider partitions of the string that fit the two rules listed below:<ol class="enumerate"><li> $|y| \geq 1$<li> $|xy| = p - 1 + 1 \leq p$</ol>Since we know that $|xy| \leq p$, we know that all possible splits of $x,y$ must be contained within the section $a^p$. This means that we can partition the string by defining some $i,j$ such that $0 \leq i$ and $j \geq 1$  and $i + j \leq p$. This means that we can rewrite our string $w$ in terms of the partition:$$w = xyz = \underbrace{a^i}_{x}\overbrace{a^j}^y\underbrace{a^{p-i-j}b^p}_z$$Thus, we know by the pumping lemma, that $w_0 = xz$ must also be in the language. However, since we know that $j \geq 1$, we know that the string $w_0$ violates this rule:$$w_0 = xz = a^{p-j}b^p$$Thus, since $p-j \neq p$ as per the definition of $j$, we know that string $w_0$ has $p-j-1$ number of $aa$'s and $p-1$ number of $bb$'s, where $p-j-1 \neq p-1$. This string is not in the language, which is a contradiction proving that $L$ is not regular.
