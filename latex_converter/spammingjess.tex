\section{Spamming Jessica}
\subsection{The Problem}
So, my friend recently made a website to display her Mechnical engineering work. It's actually an amazing website, and the work she is doing is extraodinarily cool---if you are interested, please check if out \href{https://jessicabolar.com/}{here}. But, like any good friend over winter break (with way too much time on his hands), I wanted to take this opportunity to refresh my Selenium skills. \\
\\
For those of you that don't know, Selenium is a website to automate web browsing. It allows you to interact with websites and automate that interaction, which is really cool. And while it can be used for very useful things, I decided to use it for evil. \\
\\
``Some men can't be bought, can't be reasoned with. Some men just want to watch the world burn''\\
\\
Anyway, she made the rookie mistake of leaving an email form on her website, and I thought to myself ``perfect opportunity to spam her website non-stop''. So, I wrote a Python script to do just that. Please check it out!

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]

    def spam_jess(number_of_iterations=None):

        chrome_options = Options()
        chrome_options.add_argument("--start-maximized")  

        driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install()), options=chrome_options)

        driver.get("https://www.jessicabolar.com/contact")
        count = 0

        try:

            while True:
                
                if number_of_iterations is not None and count == number_of_iterations:
                    break

                count += 1

                wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10)
                fname_field = wait.until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, "placeholder")))

                fname_field.send_keys("A very nice first name")
                lname_field.send_keys("A not inappropriate last name")
                email_field.send_keys("getspammed@gmail.com")
                describe_business.send_keys("LOL I figured out how to spam ur website")
                describe_project.send_keys("I hope you and your family have pleasant evenings")
                time.sleep(1)  

                submit_button.click()
                time.sleep(2)

                driver.refresh()

                time.sleep(2)

        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print("Loop interrupted by user.")

        finally:
            driver.quit()
