\section{The Lebron Quiz}
\subsection{Background}
This is an example ``choose-your-own adventure'' or like ``what-type-of-<x>'' are you quiz. In the name of our glorioius king, this is dedicated to the Lebron James. But in all seriousness, it's the first time I've written front-end stuff to be compatible across various device sizes. Also, I spent a decent amount of time figuring out the best way to decide a matching algorithm for the most diverse set of matches. Although the content is super goofy, it's still a cool project.\\

Special shoutout to Rishi Kosna, Geoffrey Wu, and Rohan Soni for being the greatest Lebron fans to ever exist. (NOTE) the website is still under development, so please be patient with us as we continue to make improvements.
